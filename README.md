## Description

We got our concept from a similar game on Discord called Gartic Phone who was promoting for their birthday event. Basing our game on Pictionary and Draw something, we wanted a fun multi-player game you can play with friends to pass the time! 

Select a room, guess or draw the chosen random word, and most of all have fun!
